# Requirements to run this tutorial :

To follow this tutorial you need to have the following packages installed:

⦁ Python version 2.6-2.7 or 3.3-3.5

⦁ pandas version 0.18.0 or later: http://pandas.pydata.org/ (previous versions will work for most examples as well)

⦁ numpy version 1.7 or later: http://www.numpy.org/

⦁ matplotlib version 1.3 or later: http://matplotlib.org/

⦁ ipython version 3.x with notebook support, or ipython 4.x combined with jupyter: http://ipython.org

⦁ I recommend to use the conda environment manager to install all the requirements (you can install miniconda or install the (very large) Anaconda software distribution, found at http://continuum.io/downloads).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment: conda install pandas jupyter seaborn

But of course, using another distribution (e.g. Enthought Canopy) or pip is good as well, as long as you have the above packages installed.
